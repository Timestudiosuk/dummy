### How Does Bertha AI Work?

Bertha AI is an application layer based on the GPT-3 language model by OpenAI. This powerful technology allows Bertha AI to write original content based on your input.

But HOW??

**AI works similarly to the human mind:**

When we speak or write, we string ideas, concepts, and previous knowledge to single words, or fractions of words that compile sentences, paragraphs, and finally a story.

Often we don‚Äôt know what we will say when we start to speak, We may have an idea, but the exact words are generated on the fly.
